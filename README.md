A python module to load, fit and plot chemical kinetics data. In particular, it is used to extract reaction time constants from experimental data. This data should at least describe the evolution of some of the species concentration over time. Optionally, if an electrochemical measurement was performed, the fit can also include the charge passed over time in order to improve the time constants estimation.
